# NAME(S): [Mariia Maksymenko, Caleb Thurston]
# COLLABORATION: We did everything together and we wish to have the same grade
# APPROACH:
# The approach we took after numerous tests of different methods is 
# trying to implement an algorithm like a Depth First Search (with 
# additional features) since it gave us better results more consistenly 
# than Breadth First search or our attempt at A*. First, we used a combination 
# of a set to track visited cells, a dictionary to count how many times each 
# cell has been visited, and a list to keep track of the path for backtracking.
# So, each time the agent receives new percepts, it updates its current state, including
# its position and visit counts and also checks if the exit is reachable and starts
# going in that direction immediately. And if it is not immediately reachable, the 
# agent should move to either unvisited cells or cells that have been visited the 
# least number of times.We utilize the coordinate system by keeping track of the 
# agent's current position with a (x,y) pair, and appending to a dictionary the 
# coordinates of where it just was, as well as the direction it moved to get there.
# We also needed a form of backtracking to previously visited locations, but not too
# much, since it caused wasting turns on already explored "regions". If the agent 
# exhausts its options, it defaults to a random direction, which is not ideal, but it
# needs to exist as an option. We also tried to take measures to avoid running into 
# walls and make it so the agent doesnâ€™t get trapped in loops. Loops are the biggest
# problem to us, however our agent seems to do a good job around 90% of the time. 
# With# how we've programmed it, it'll consistently run really well for a long time, 
# and then all of a sudden it'll try a direction that completely throws off the run, 
# or get into a loop. This version has the most consistency but every now and then it 
# will have a couple really bad runs.
